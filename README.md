# Fire-Truck-Robot
A team of 5 students from various engineering disciplines collaborated on the Fire Truck project, aimed at children aged 5 to 15. The project's goal is to develop a toy that not only entertains as well as aligns with educational objectives, fostering cognitive development and enhancing children's thinking skills.
